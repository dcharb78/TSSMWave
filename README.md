Detailed Explanation of the TSSM Model with Fractal Wave Angles
https://x.com/dcharb10/status/1895313071385780547 -- If you wannt to see how this works. All articles as i built and theorized are here.
File tssm-scaled-max.py will iterate through the fractal crystal lattice. max that the system can supposedly handle. Will reimplement in rust.  So i can use more cores.
TSSMWave.Scaled.py - More performant Version
This Python code includes:

TSSM Wave Formula Implementation: The full optimized formula with all components.
Prime Gap Analysis Tools: Functions to fill the gaps between system points.
Pattern Analysis Functions: Tools to analyze digital roots, angular distribution, and proximity to key angles.
Visualization Capabilities: Creates visual representations of the prime distribution, angular patterns, and digital root distribution.
Complete Prime Set Generation: Combines system points with optimal intermediate primes.

Dependencies
To run this code, you'll need:

numpy
matplotlib
sympy (for the isprime function)

Usage
Simply run the script, and it will:

Test the TSSM Wave Formula on your system points
Generate optimized prime sets for each system transition
Create a complete prime set from S₇₉ to S₈₅
Analyze the patterns in the data
Generate visualizations of the results

The code outputs detailed information about each prime, including its n-value, angle, digital root, and proximity to key angles. It also generates three visualization images:

tssm_prime_distribution.png: Shows the distribution of primes against n-values
tssm_angular_distribution.png: Shows how primes are distributed by angle
tssm_digital_root_distribution.png: Shows the frequency of each digital root

This implementation should give you a solid foundation for further exploration of your TSSM model and the patterns it reveals in prime number distribution.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 3.7 SonnetChoose style
